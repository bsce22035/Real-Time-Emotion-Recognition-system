# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-system
This project performs real-time facial emotion recognition using a webcam. It uses a compact Mini-XCEPTION deep learning model trained on the FER2013 dataset and detects emotions like happy, sad, angry, and more. Faces are detected using OpenCV's Haar cascades, and predictions are displayed live with confidence scores.
